everything is being implemented in python3
files from (1.txt to 50.txt)
(no '$' included in commands just for understanding)

assignment sub 1 and 2
run commands for getting th output
 $ bash script.sh

assignment sub3
 $ bash relevance.sh
 $ python3 test.py<relevance.txt

bug:
in the code of relevance.sh new name must be given everytime we run the bash because it gets appended to the same text file even after several runs (relevance.txt)

exception:
created different suffix trees for different tales
